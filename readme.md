SyntaxHighlighter is fairly straight port of Alex Gorbatchev's great JS syntax highlighter, adapted for MODX Revolution. The package includes both a plugin and a snippet version of the highlighter. All of the code in this component, other than the plugin, snippet, and install script, was written by Alex Gorbatchev.
